## 0.1.16

### Patch Changes

- d9fd798cc8: The Core App API now automatically instruments all route location changes using
  the new Analytics API. Each location change triggers a `navigate` event, which
  is an analogue of a "pageview" event in traditional web analytics systems. In
  addition to the path, these events provide plugin-level metadata via the
  analytics context, which can be useful for analyzing plugin usage:

  ```json
  {
    "action": "navigate",
    "subject": "/the-path/navigated/to?with=params#and-hashes",
    "context": {
      "extension": "App",
      "pluginId": "id-of-plugin-that-exported-the-route",
      "routeRef": "associated-route-ref-id"
    }
  }
  ```

  These events can be identified and handled by checking for the action
  `navigate` and the extension `App`.

## 0.1.10

### Patch Changes

- cfcb486aa: Add system icons for the built-in entity types and use them in the entity list of the `catalog-import` plugin.
- 392b36fa1: Added support for using authenticating via GitHub Apps in addition to GitHub OAuth Apps. It used to be possible to use GitHub Apps, but they did not handle session refresh correctly.

  Note that GitHub Apps handle OAuth scope at the app installation level, meaning that the `scope` parameter for `getAccessToken` has no effect. When calling `getAccessToken` in open source plugins, one should still include the appropriate scope, but also document in the plugin README what scopes are required in the case of GitHub Apps.

  In addition, the `authHandler` and `signInResolver` options have been implemented for the GitHub provider in the auth backend.

### Patch Changes

- 9d40fcb1e: - Bumping `material-ui/core` version to at least `4.12.2` as they made some breaking changes in later versions which broke `Pagination` of the `Table`.
  - Switching out `material-table` to `@material-table/core` for support for the later versions of `material-ui/core`
  - This causes a minor API change to `@backstage/core-components` as the interface for `Table` re-exports the `prop` from the underlying `Table` components.
  - `onChangeRowsPerPage` has been renamed to `onRowsPerPageChange`
  - `onChangePage` has been renamed to `onPageChange`
  - Migration guide is here: https://material-table-core.com/docs/breaking-changes

  - @backstage/core-plugin-api@0.1.3

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 9bca2a252: Fixes a type bug where supplying all app icons to `createApp` was required, rather than just a partial list.
- 75b8537ce: This change adds automatic error boundaries around extensions.

  This means that all exposed parts of a plugin are wrapped in a general error boundary component, that is plugin aware. The default design for the error box is borrowed from `@backstage/errors`. To override the default "fallback", one must provide a component named `ErrorBoundaryFallback` to `createApp`, like so:

  ```ts
  const app = createApp({
    components: {
      ErrorBoundaryFallback: props => {
        // a custom fallback component
        return (
          <>
            <h1>Oops.</h1>
            <h2>
              The plugin {props.plugin.getId()} failed with{' '}
              {props.error.message}
            </h2>
            <button onClick={props.resetError}>Try again</button>
          </>
        );
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  The props here include:

  - `error`. An `Error` object or something that inherits it that represents the error that was thrown from any inner component.
  - `resetError`. A callback that will simply attempt to mount the children of the error boundary again.
  - `plugin`. A `BackstagePlugin` that can be used to look up info to be presented in the error message. For instance, you may want to keep a map of your internal plugins and team names or slack channels and present these when an error occurs. Typically, you'll do that by getting the plugin ID with `plugin.getId()`.

- da8cba44f: Deprecate and disable the extension creation methods, which were added to this package by mistake and should only exist within `@backstage/core-plugin-api`.
- 9bca2a252: Update `createApp` options to allow plugins with unknown output types in order to improve forwards and backwards compatibility.
