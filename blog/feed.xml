<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Backstage has turned two. Of course, this is software, so we expect things to move fast. But when you have a passionate, worldwide community building together, we’ve now seen firsthand just how fast that can be. We’re marking our second year as a community by becoming a CNCF incubating project, reaching 100 public adopters, releasing version 1.0 of the core app, and other very nice birthday gifts. Rather than a toddler finding their feet, Backstage today is beginning to look awfully grown-up for a two-year-old.</p>

<p><em>TLDR;</em> We’re excited to announce the arrival of homepage templates for Backstage.

This template can be found in our <a href="https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-templates--default-template">Backstage Storybook</a>, as well as future templates that we build.</p>

<p>What a year 2021 has been for the Backstage project and community. As the year comes to a close, we can look back at some of the happenings, the successes, and welcome all the newcomers to our growing community.</p>
<p>In a year that has had its fair share of ups and downs, this community has been something that has brought me so much in the support you provide each other, your eagerness, passion, and willingness to share. Thank you to all of you for creating such a great community, and welcome to everyone joining us. I can’t wait to meet you all and see what great things we can create together in the new year.</p>
<p>In 2021 we’ve seen the project and community grow in every dimension, reaching over 75 public adopters, over 500 contributors from around the world all bringing new ideas and perspectives. We’ve had so many of you sharing and demoing your hard work in our monthly community sessions, added new plugins, built new features and really started to see Backstage have an impact for engineering teams across so many of our users.</p>
<p>Now let’s hear from the maintainers and look at the stats!</p>

<p>Before digging into why we believe this is so important, we want to send a huge “thank you” to all the Backstage adopters and contributors who have helped grow the Backstage community. First, to the publicly listed adopters as your visible support for the project excites others to learn more about Backstage. Second, to those non-listed adopters, many of whom still engage in the community via issues, comments, or code contributions. Thank you!</p>

Throughout the year, we’ve been focussed on improving the stability and scalability of these areas while enhancing the feature sets based upon requests from the community. Software Templates — which enable push-button deployments with all your standards and best practices built-in — is our first feature-complete release candidate to graduate to beta. Read on to learn how this release improves template customization and flexibility, as well as performance.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> The new Backstage Search is now available in alpha, ready for you to start building on. A total rethinking of the core search feature in Backstage, it’s more than just a box you type into — it’s a mini platform all by itself. With its composable frontend and extensible backend, you can design and build the search tool that suits your organization’s needs.</p>
<p>So, you don’t just get an improved out-of-the-box experience for searching whatever is in your software catalog. You can also add support for searching other sources, too. Customize it the way you want and you can search your catalog, your plugins and docs — and even external sources, like Stack Overflow and Confluence — all at once, all right inside Backstage.</p>
<p>With one query, your teams can find exactly what they’re looking for: anything and everything.</p>

In just over a year, Backstage has gone from a few open source building blocks to a thriving platform used by engineering orgs with thousands of developers.

<em><a href="https://backstage.spotify.com">backstage.spotify.com</a></em></p>
<p>The Backstage community is growing! In just over <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/03/16/happy-birthday-backstage-spotifys-biggest-open-source-project-grows-up-fast/">a year</a>, Backstage has gone from a few open source building blocks to a thriving platform used by engineering orgs with thousands of developers. But even with 30+ <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md">adopting companies</a> and 400+ contributors, we are still in the very early stages of reaching the platform’s potential.</p>
<p>In order to grow Backstage further, Spotify is increasing the support we provide both adopters (the people integrating Backstage into their organizations) and contributors (the people building features and improving the code). The more companies that adopt Backstage, the more support the project gets, the stronger the platform becomes for everyone.</p>
<p>And while Spotify remains committed to maturing the Backstage platform — both as original creator and active maintainer — we also want to make room for the community to take greater ownership. Backstage may have started inside Spotify, but it belongs to all of you. So, we hope you join us in what’s next.</p>

<p>One of the greatest strengths of Backstage also presents a never-ending challenge: Backstage is highly customizable and allows you to easily build a unique developer portal suited to your organization’s needs. The downside of this flexibility is that it can be hard to know where to start. Backstage can do so many things — integrating every part of your tech infrastructure and developer experience — but if you set off building a developer portal without a plan, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the possibilities. To help you form your plan, this post will detail how Spotify came to design our internal portal and recommend potential models for you to use when designing and building your own.</p>

<p>TLDR; We’re rethinking the Kubernetes developer experience with a new feature: a Kubernetes monitoring tool that’s designed around the needs of service owners, not cluster admins. Now developers can easily check the health of their services no matter how or where those services are deployed — whether it’s on a local host for testing or in production on dozens of clusters around the world.</p>
<p>And since Backstage uses the native Kubernetes API, the feature works with whichever cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) or managed service (OpenShift, IBM Cloud, GKE, etc.) you already use.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Backstage is heading out of alpha and moving onto the path to stable releases and an eventual version 1.0. As the community and ecosystem continue to grow at an increasing rate, we want to provide a solid foundation for everyone building things in, with, and around Backstage. So, today we’re introducing the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/versioning-policy">Stability Index</a> — a simple way to find out how likely (or unlikely) a specific package or plugin inside Backstage might be updated with major changes. By indicating the reliability of key features and APIs, this quick reference will help contributors and adopters better plan and coordinate their development efforts going forward.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>How did Spotify save millions on cloud costs within a matter of months?? We made cost optimization just another part of the daily development process. Our newly open sourced <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/cost-insights">Cost Insights plugin</a> makes a team’s cloud costs visible — and actionable — right inside Backstage. So engineers can see the impact of their cloud usage (down to a product and resource level) and make optimizations wherever and whenever it makes sense. By managing cloud costs from the ground up, you can make smarter decisions that let you continue to build and scale quickly, without wasting resources.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Backstage has an ambitious goal: to provide engineers with the best possible developer experience.</p>
<p>A great developer experience leads to happy, creative, and productive engineers. Our belief is that engineers should not have to be experts in various infrastructure tools or disciplines (e.g., machine learning or backend) to be productive. Infrastructure should be abstracted away, so that developers can spend more cycles building and testing, quickly and safely. Backstage unifies all your infrastructure tooling, services, and documentation to create a streamlined development environment from end to end.</p>
<p>Now you may be thinking, “Yeah, sure, that sounds nice and all, but how does Backstage actually abstract away infrastructure?” The short answer: <a href="https://backstage.io/plugins">plugins</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Today we are announcing a new Backstage feature: Software Templates. Simplify setup, standardize tooling, and deploy with the click of a button. Using automated templates, your engineers can spin up a new microservice, website, or other software component with your organization’s best practices built-in, right from the start.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/blog/assets/20-07-01/auth-landing.png" alt="auth-landing-page"></p>
<p>Getting authentication right is important. It helps keep your platform safe, it’s one of the first things users will interact with, and there are many different authentication providers to support. To this end, we chose to use <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/">Passport</a> to provide an easy-to-use, out-of-the-box experience that can be extended to your own, pre-existing authentication providers (known as strategies). The Auth APIs in Backstage serve two purposes: identify the user and provide a way for plugins to request access to third-party services on behalf of the user. We’ve already implemented Google and GitHub authentication to provide examples and to get you started.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Today we are announcing the availability of the Backstage Service Catalog in alpha. This has been the community’s most requested feature. Even if the catalog is not ready for production yet, we think this release already demonstrates how Backstage can provide value for your company right out of the box. With your early input and feedback, we hope to create a stronger generally available product.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Thanks to the help from the Backstage community, we’ve made excellent progress and are now moving into Phase 2 of Backstage — building out a Service Catalog and the surrounding systems that will help unify the tools you use to manage your software.</p>
<p>We released the open source version of Backstage a little less than two months ago, and have been thrilled to see so many people jumping in and contributing to the project in its early stages. We’re excited to see what the community can build together as we progress through <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage#project-roadmap">each phase of Backstage</a>.</p>

<p>One of the great things about the open source community is once you put your work out there, you really never know where it might end up. That’s certainly the case here.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We wanted to make getting started with Backstage as easy as possible. Even though Backstage is still in the early phases of its development, we believe it is important for our users to get a feel for what Backstage really is.</p>
<p>We want users to be able to create their own version of Backstage quickly and easily, so that they can take advantage of all the infrastructure that we’ve built into it — and start exploring.</p>
<p>In this blog post we’ll look at what a Backstage app is and how to create one using our <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/cli">CLI</a>.</p>

<p>Two days ago, we released the open source version of <a href="https://backstage.io/">Backstage</a>, our homegrown developer portal. And we learned a thing or two via the feedback we received. So, I wanted to take this opportunity to further explain what we’re trying to do with Backstage — and more importantly, what we want to give to the greater engineering community beyond Spotify.</p>

<p>Backstage is Spotify's open source platform for building developer portals.</p>
<p>It’s the first open source infrastructure platform by Spotify that allows you to focus on building your application instead of reinventing the button. With an elegant and unified, yet opinionated UI/UX for all your tooling and infrastructure, Backstage enables engineers to get up and running faster, which ultimately makes their lives easier and more productive.</p>
